# Face-Recognition
This project focuses on performing face recognition using the ORL dataset, which contains images of 40 subjects. Each subject has 10 grayscale images of size 92x112 pixels. The goal is to identify the subject of a given image by leveraging machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
